## Author's Notes

- Applied a sliding effect whenever the user submits the form. This was not required.

- You can view all the project's jQuery/JS files in the scripts folder **/public/scripts**.

- Implemented SASS before finalizing the project. You can view all the project's partials in the scss folder **/public/scss**. SASS auto-generates a stylesheet file which can be viewed in my css folder **/public/css**.
